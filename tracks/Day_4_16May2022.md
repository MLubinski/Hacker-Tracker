# Today Hacks
- Playing the HTB Cyber Apocalypse CTF over the weekend.
  - No solo solves for me yet but my partner is killing it. This is moderately discouraging but I hope to do enough portions of a variety of challenges that I can learn more than I have so far when the solutions are posted.
  - The challenges I've been involved with include playing with blind SSRF, Powershell, C code, and SVG files.
- First time I've ever actually used Burp Collaborator for anything useful.
