# Today Hacks
- Completed the following [PortSwigger Academy OAuth labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth). Only 2-3 to go.
  - [Authentication bypass via OAuth implicit flow]()
  - [Forced OAuth profile linking]()
  - [OAuth account hijacking via redirect_uri]()
  - [Stealing OAuth access tokens via an open redirect]()

# Tomorrow Hacks
- Not sure I'll continue daily updates on the weekends.
- [Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2022](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/ctfs) starts Saturday. Plan on participating throughout the week when available.

# Personal Hacks
- Nothing today. Primarily a hands on keyboard day.

# Hack Distractions
- Warm weather Friday slowed things down a bit but it's good for the psyche. I'll take the trade.

# Shower Thoughts
- The OAuth labs are harder to completely understand than expected. Will likely look for more OAuth boxes and exercises after complete with the PortSwigger Academy ones to get a good grip on things.
- Expect to take OAuth lessons learned and see if I can apply them to Bug Bounty targets.

#### My rating for today: 4/5
