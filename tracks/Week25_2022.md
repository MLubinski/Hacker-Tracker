# This Week's Hacks
- *Redacted* work items. Lots of test runs with the new script(s) and finding new ways to report on results. Well received with good new results so far.
- Some research on [http headers](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html). Attempting to determine whats normal and whats not. I'm afraid this will be ongoing as the new *redacted* processes identify more and more.
