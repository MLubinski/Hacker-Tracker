# Today
- I created this thing.
- Experimenting with 2 new Yubikeys.
- Redeemed the 1 month of Pentesterlab Pro I won from [Spiderfoot](https://twitter.com/spiderfoot)
  - Completed the intro and first 15 recon challenges. Pretty easy so far but recon is sort of my jam.
- Periodic Nuclei runs searching for misconfigurations

# Thoughts
- Maybe I need to structure this thing some more.
