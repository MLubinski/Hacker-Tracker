# Today Hacks
- Playing the HTB Cyber Apocalypse CTF.
  - Still no solo solves which is becoming quite defeating. I'm stuck on 2 challenges where I feel I'm 80% complete.
  - Mean lessons about cross-origin resource sharing.
  - Researching how [Node cookie-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session) works so I can reverse a cookie.
  - [Digital Ocean droplets also have a metadata API.](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/retrieve-droplet-metadata/)
- Read a bit about standard usage of [Firebase API keys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys) and this post titled [Expanding the Attack Surface: React Native Android Applications](https://blog.assetnote.io/bug-bounty/2020/02/01/expanding-attack-surface-react-native/), also [Keyshacks](https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks?s=09#Firebase).

# Tomorrow Hacks
- Last day for the CTF, maybe get a solve?!
- Evaluate more recon tools for *redacted* day job tasks.

# Personal Hacks
- First attempted light jog after knee surgery in January, not great, walked the majority.

# Hack Distractions
None

# Shower Thoughts
- My notes for the CTF are full of no solutions and look like a half eaten sandwich but maybe I should clean them up, explain whats there a bit better, and upload them here as the first publicized notes.

#### My rating for today: 2/5
